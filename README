HP-GL plot file re-sequencer

Crude tool to change the order in which HPGL plots are drawn.
Currently hardcoded to work with HP 4195A outputs which draws the grid on top of signal traces !

Eventually could take an arg in hp2xx style : '-r PPPPPP'
where each P is a digit 1-9 to specify the ordering.

typical HP 4195A PLT :

SP5 for green comments/text
SP3 grey text
SP1 yellow text ?
SP2 cyan text ?
SP4 white text
SP1 yellow trace
SP2 cyan trace
SP3 grey graticule
SP0 terminator

so we output SP1 and SP2 last.


## example usage:
`./reorder -f orig.plt -o better.plt `
